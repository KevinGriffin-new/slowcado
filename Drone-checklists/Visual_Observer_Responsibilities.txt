Visual Observer Responsibilities
--------------------------------

Main role of the Visual Observer (VO)

☐	A Visual Observer (VO) is a trained RPAS crew member who assists the Pilot in
	Command (PIC) in ensuring the safe conduct of a flight. The VO serves as a
	second set of eyes to support the PIC to maintain VLOS to the RPAS and to aid in
	Detect and Avoid Functions.

VO Responsibilities

☐	The VO shall systematically scan the area of flight and surrounding area for
	potential hazards to the flight, including conflicting air traffic, hazards to
	aviation safety or hazards to persons on the ground, and immediately communicate
	such hazards to the PIC (see list of hazards below)
☐	The VO shall maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) with the RPAS at all times,
	and shall immediately inform the PIC if VLOS is lost.
☐	If the VO needs to break VLOS (for example, to scan an area well away from the
	RPAS), the VO must pass VLOS responsibilities to the PIC or other crew member
	for the duration of this task
☐	The VO shall be familiar with the mission, such that potential hazards can be
	anticipated and where applicable, contingency plans can be developed in concert
	with the PIC (see list of hazards below)
☐	The VO should be aware of the limits associated with potential hazards (eg,
	maximum wind speed for the RPAS) in order to appropriately alert the PIC

Potential hazards the VO should be aware of, and know the limits for

☐	Airspace hazards:  manned aircraft, aerodromes in the vicinity, air traffic
	patterns, airspace types, applicable NOTAMs, potential birds/wildlife
☐	Ground hazards:  location and height of buildings, towers, structures,
	wires/cables, trees, terrain features
☐	People hazards: advertised events, locations and potential paths of bystanders,
	other RPAS operators
☐	Environmental hazards:  weather conditions and forecast (particularly wind,
	temperature, and precipitation), Kp-Index

General requirements

☐	The VO must always comply with instructions from the PIC during flight time
☐	The VO must be able to communicate effectively and in a timely manner with the
	PIC, either directly or via an agreed-upon, reliable communications device
☐	The VO must be fit to perform their duty, including not ingesting alcohol or
	drugs within 12 hours of the flight, and not being subject to fatigue
☐	The VO must be able to perform their duties with unaided sight, without
	instruments such as binoculars
☐	The VO must not operate a moving vehicle, vessel or aircraft while performing
	their in-flight VO duties
☐	The VO must be familiar with RPAS regulations applicable to the type of
	operation being performed (Basic or Advanced)
☐	The VO must be familiar with the RPAS in operation and it's limitations (eg
	minimum temperature, maximum wind), and have access to the RPAS's operating manual
☐	The VO shall perform VO duties for only one RPAS at a time (exceptions: see
	901.40 or SFOC)
☐	The VO may aid in other duties, per the PIC's instructions, as long as such
	tasks do not interfere with their ability to perform their in-flight VO duties. 
	Examples of other duties include pre-flight site assessment, checklist
	read-outs, ground crew supervision, or crowd control.
