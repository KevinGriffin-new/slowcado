Airspace Assessment

☐	Ensure flight will be 5.6 km (3 NM) away from airports or military aerodromes,
	and 1.9 km (1 NM) away from heliports.  Check app for safe flying zones. Check
	NRC Drone Site Selection web page. Check NAV CANADA's Canada Flight Supplements

☐	Ensure flight will not be in Controlled Airspace or Restricted Airspace.  Check
	app for safe flying zones. Check NRC Drone Site Selection web page. Check

	zones. Check NRC Drone Site Selection web page. Check NAV CANADA's Canada Flight
	Supplements and Water Aerodrome Supplements
☐	Ensure no impacting temporary aviation restrictions are in effect.  Check the
	NAV CANADA NOTAM site.
☐	Check visually and audibly for nearby low-altitude air operations such as
	helicopters, seaplanes, hot air balloons, and ultra-light aircraft

Ground Hazard Assessment

☐	Take note of potential obstacles such as buildings, wires, trees, cell towers,
	wind turbines. Check maps for marked obstacles.
☐	Check for and plan to stay clear of land-based airspace restrictions, including

Weather & Environmental Factors

☐	Check suitability of current weather and weather forecast for the duration of
	the operation (wind, rain, snow, fog, temperature
☐	Check that the Kp index is suitable for the flight (ideally less than 4)
☐	Check for and avoid potential dust or dirt clouds
☐	Determine the maximum safe range for the operation, based upon site details,
	current weather conditions, and battery charge

Bystander Locations

☐	Ensure bystanders are at least 30m away from aircraft at all times
☐	Ensure crew and other involved parties are aware of the flight and stand clear.
☐	Stay at least 30m away from advertised events such as parades, sporting events,
